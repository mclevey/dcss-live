## INTRODUCTION

In this chapter and the two that follow, we shift our focus from text analysis to network analysis. We will start with a three-chapter sequence on descriptive and exploratory methods and set inferential approaches aside for now. This chapter lays a conceptual and practical foundation for the descriptive and inferential methods introduced in later chapters.

This chapter is organized into three main sections. The first clarifies what social networks are and why they matter. We'll start by discussing how structural and relational thinking differentiates network analysis from the predominant focus on attributes of statistically independent individuals in much of traditional quantitative social science. We will briefly discuss some prominent perspectives about what networks are and why they matter. This sets the stage for comparing common ways of conceptualizing social networks, including: as patterns of (*i*) sentiments, (*ii*) access and opportunity structures, (*iii*) socially constructed role relations, and (*iv*) behavioural interactions [@kitts2014beyond; @kitts2020rethinking]. These ways of thinking about networks have important implications for the questions, data, theory, methods and models we will use. 

The second section focuses on storing and working with network data. I describe some common ways researchers represent the complexity of real world network structures and processes using relational data structures, including edgelists, matrices, and attribute files. These data structures are capable of encoding a wide-variety of relational information and can be adapted to the specifics of your research projects. You will learn how to construct graph objects from these data structures using the NetworkX package. The third section introduces the ideas of a network "walk-structure" (the chains of direct and indirect connections that link pairs of nodes in a network) and "contagions" flowing through network structure. 

The concepts introduced in this chapter are foundational to many methods and models in network analysis and will be referenced frequently in future chapters, so it is important to be familiar with them before tackling more complex methods and models. 

Finally, before we dive in, I want to briefly acknowledge that network analysis is a massive interdisciplinary field with a history that is over 100 years old in the social sciences and several decades old in other sciences. While many of the foundational ideas endure, the theories, methods, measures, and models that define the field have transformed many times [see e.g., @freeman2004development] and are changing again with the adoption of new kinds of datasets and the creation and improvement of computationally-intensive models. It's impossible to offer a comprehensive introduction to network analysis in the 6 chapters dedicated to networks in this book, so I've had to make some very difficult decisions about what to emphasize. I've elected to focus on some of the most enduring ideas in these initial three chapters and to emphasize computational approaches to inferential network analysis in Chapter 31. I set aside many topics that are fascinating and worthy, to keep this a general introduction to computational social science. Where appropriate, I have tried to include directions to other resources that can better cover topics beyond the scope of this book.

## WHAT ARE SOCIAL NETWORKS?

### From Independent Individuals to Networks

Lin Freeman's [-@freeman2004development] history of social network analysis starts with a colorful (and slightly unsettling) quote from an American sociologist in the late-1960s that gets straight to the core of the difference between network analysis and the traditional quantitative social science of his day:

> For the last thirty years, empirical social research has been dominated by the sample survey. But as usually practiced, using random sampling of individuals, the survey is a sociological meatgrinder, tearing the individual from his (sic.) social context and guaranteeing that nobody in the study interacts with anyone else in it. It is a little like a biologist putting his (sic.) experimental animals through a hamburger machine and looking at every hundredth cell through a microscope; anatomy and physiology get lost, structure and function disappear, and one is left with cell biology... If our aim to is to understand people's behaviour rather than simply to record it, we want to know about primary groups, neighbourhoods, organizations, social circles, and communities; about interaction, communication, role expectations, and social control.  
> 
> Allen @barton1968bringing

While many people still practice this kind of "meatgrinder" research, Barton's distinction is much less salient now than it used to be. Mainstream quantitative social science has changed a *lot* since he wrote that in 1968, and again since he was quoted by Freeman in 2004. For one thing, network analysis is no longer just an obscure undertaking of mathematically-inclined sociologists, social psychologists, and other social scientists; it's well within the mainstream of applied quantitative science across dozens of disciplines and is an important research area in contemporary statistics. 

Network analysis is one of several major developments in quantitative data analysis that attempts to model interdependent relationships and institutional contexts. Another, multilevel analysis (or hierarchical modelling), will be covered in Chapter 29. Both seek to explicitly model the complex interdependencies between entities (e.g., people) by emphasizing their shared *contexts*, *relationships*, and *interactions*. However, in network analysis, an entity's context is typically their connections to other entities and their structural position in a network (a concept we will discuss briefly here and again in later chapters). In multilevel analysis, an entity's context is typically some sort of institutional environment that is shared with other entities, such as classrooms in a school, teams in a league, provinces or states in a country, or countries in the world polity [see @buhari2010stanford; @meyer2009world on world polity theory and Stanford school institutionalism]. In a multilevel network analysis [see @lazega2015multilevel], the context would be the entities' concrete connections with one another nested in one of many possible shared institutional contexts, such as networks of informal relations between employees nested in the specific firms they work for [e.g., @brailly2016embeddedness]. 

We care about these network connections and shared institutional contexts for many reasons. Perhaps the most obvious is that we think complex interdependencies have important effects on specific outcomes that we care about. For example, we might hypothesize that whether someone believes misinformation that vaccines cause autism depends in part on the beliefs of the people they interact with frequently or whom they trust the most. Or we might hypothesize that one's overall health and wellbeing depends in part on the health and wellbeing of the people they are connected to. The logic is similar for multilevel analysis, but what follows "depends in part on" would refer to some sort of shared institutional context or environment rather than a complex network of concrete relationships and interactions.

Not all hypotheses about how networks influence individual outcomes are based on *direct* connections, however. My friends influence me, but their friends (including those whom I am not friends with) influence them, and my friends' friends' friends influence them, and so on. Each step out in such a friendship network usually brings new, but diminished, influences. Networks are *complex systems*; what happens in one region of the network can affect disparate regions, and seemingly small differences in micro-level interaction processes (e.g., norms around who you interact with, how you interact with them, and what they mean to you) can have dramatic macro-level outcomes. For example, we might design a network study to better understand how micro-level social norms generate macro-level structures that shape disease transmission dynamics [@bearman2004chains], or how network structures differently impact the spread of an infectious disease through a population and the adoption of health behaviours necessary to mitigate the spread of that disease [@centola2018behavior].

We also care about networks and institutional contexts because, as social scientists, we want to understand networks and institutions for their own sakes, inclusive of the social and political processes that generate different kinds of structural configurations. This might be because we are interested in advancing scientific knowledge by doing rigorous theory-driven research, or because we want to leverage that knowledge for some applied reason, such as intervening in a network to mitigate the effects of misinformation and disinformation, to disrupt the diffusion of a violent political ideology, or to improve health and wellbeing.

This is what makes networks so interesting and beautiful: we are all linked together in a vast and dense web of intersecting, meaningful, and mutually-influential relationships. But this complexity can quickly get out of hand. There's a reason why old fashioned quantitative social science worked like a meatgrinder: it was extremely difficult to do much of anything else. Consequently, the history of network analysis is full of fascinating stories of intrepid sociologists, social psychologists, anthropologists, and other social scientists coming up with clever new mathematical models to describe and analyze interdependent relationships, and developing research software to use those models in applied research. Now that network analysis is being practiced across so many scientific fields, methods and models are improving at breakneck speed.

Just about anything that a social scientist might be interested in can be usefully described in network terms, and just about any research question you might ask could be cast as a question about networks, where the network or some network-based variable might be: 

- part of an explanation for something else, such as why some people practice safe sex while others don't, or 
- the thing we are trying to explain, such as why some schools have racially segregated friendship networks while others do not.

Does this mean you *should* model everything as a network and pose every question as a question about networks? No (though as a network scientist and sociologist I'm tempted to say yes). Recall Box's loop: your model should be whatever will best answer your question.

Freeman didn't include it in his excerpt of Barton's 1968 article, but just a bit further down the page, Barton poses an important question: "*what do we want?*" Different things, of course. Network analysis is diverse and interdisciplinary, and you can find meaningful divisions between different groups of network analysts that use different tools to answer different questions. But what unites network scientists of virtually every social science, now and in the past, is a paradigmatic preference for holistic research strategies that focus on people and groups embedded in complex interdependent relationships. Let's turn towards some of the various ways network analysts have conceptualized those relationships.

### What is a Network? 

The spread of network analysis to and from so many scientific fields, often with developments occurring independently of one another, has produced a variety of synonymous terms in network analysis. These interchangeable terms can be confusing when you first run into them. For clarity, we will say that networks consist of a set of entities, which we will usually call **nodes** (also called **vertices** or **actors**), and the relationships between those entities, **edges** (also called **ties** or **arcs**). In theory, a node can be any kind of entity and an edge can be any kind of relationship or interaction between such entities. In the social sciences, we typically work with *social* networks where the nodes have some sort of agency, such as individual people or groups of people (e.g., an organization), and the edges represent some sort of meaningful relationship between them. Following @kitts2014beyond and @kitts2020rethinking, we can categorize these common types of edges as defined by:

1. **patterns of sentiment**, such as who likes or dislikes whom;
2. **socially-constructed role relations**, such as friendships, research collaborations, romantic partnerships, doctoral student and supervisor relationships, family;
3. **behavioural interactions and contact over time**, such as who messages whom;
4. **providing access to resources, support, information, and opportunities**, such as who contacts whom for advice in a personal crisis, to discuss a problem at work, or to pick up your groceries while quarantining in a global pandemic.

These four types of edges provide us with a high-level framework for talking about *types* of networks based on the relational information they encode and, importantly, the questions we want to answer and the theories we are using. In many respects, the type of relation that defines the edges in a network is the most important thing in determining what *type* of network you have, and what you can reasonably do with it. I emphasize that one of the most common mistakes that novices make is trying to answer a research question, or apply a theory, that is a poor match for the type of network, like trying to answer a question about power and inequality with data on a collaboration network. It *can* work with the right data and a bit of mental gymnastics, but it shouldn't have to. *As with any other type of research*, this is a match that you want to ensure you get right. This is, once again, a matter of good research design. 

Graphically, we can represent **nodes as points** and **edges as lines** that connect those nodes. Figure @fig-14_01 is a hypothetical network with five nodes (Chen, Nate, Anika, Anvita, and Patrick) and the relationships between them. When two nodes are connected, such as Chen and Anvita, we say they are **adjacent**. If we choose to focus on a specific node, we refer to it as the **ego**, and the nodes ego is directly connected to can be referred to as **alters**. Together, an ego's alters represent a **neighbourhood**. For example, if we are focused on Patrick, Patrick is "ego," and their neighbourhood would consist of the alters Anvita, Chen, and Anika. 

We'll come up with a fictitious story about information sharing in this network later in the chapter. For now, let's just focus on learning some technical vocabulary and understanding how we can represent social networks with relational data structures.

![Cap](figures/walks_2.pdf)

The edges have arrows because the network is **directed** as opposed to **undirected**. For example, there is an arrow pointing from Anika to Chen because Anika *sends* something to Chen, or initiates something with Chen, that Chen may not reciprocate. Many interactions and relationships can be represented this way. Email and SMS communication can be modelled as directed interactions: "Anika **emails** Chen" becomes an edge **from** Anika **to** Chen. Requests for support or advice can be modelled as coming from one person ("help, please!") and the support or advice being sent back in return ("Here you go!"). In a network defined by patterns of sentiment, one person may like another who may or may not like them back. Other types of relationship don't make sense to represent as directed. While one node might nominate another node as a "friend" and not be nominated in return (tragic!), this really shouldn't be the case in coauthorship. If Anika wrote a book with Chen, Chen must also have written a book with Anika.

Networks are simply relational mathematical objects and have no inherent visual form. The image above is just a common and convenient way of *representing* relational data for small networks. However, just as a scatterplot is a representation of data, rather than the data itself, so too is the above image. With networks, as with text, it's matrices all the way down. In this case, it's a square **adjacency matrix**. Consider Figure @fig-14_02, which shows how the graphical network representations of the network (directed on the left, undirected on the right) align with two different adjacency matrices.

![Cap](figures/matrices_graphs.pdf)

First, for both the directed network (left) and the undirected network (right), many cells are empty, which represents 0, or the absence of an edge. The diagonals are highlighted in gray, but this is just to emphasize them. The diagonals are 0 because the nodes in these networks are not permitted to connect to themselves, which means that there are no **self-loops**. In other types of networks, such as email communication networks, self-loops might be possible, and a self-loop could be created by an action such as a node emailing themselves.

If you look closely at the undirected network's adjacency matrix, you will notice that the data above and below the diagonal are mirror images of one another, but not in the directed network. That's because you can have relational asymmetry in a directed network (Anika can send a tie to Chen that Chen does not reciprocate) but not in an undirected network.

Both of these networks are **binary**; the adjacency matrices contain 0s (not shown) to represent the absence of an edge and 1s to represent their presence. However, we can populate these cells with plenty of other information, often interpreted as some sort of **edge weight**. For example, in an interaction network we might populate cells with count data representing frequency of interaction within a given time frame. In a sentiment network, we might populate the cells with numbers that indicate different types or levels of sentiment, such as a Likert scale from 1 - 5 or a set of distinctions such as "strong" and "weak." There is a lot of flexibility in how these data are collected, and it is largely up to you are to make decisions that make sense in the context of your research project.

Traditionally, researchers have focused on *positive* ties like friendship, support and sharing, or collaboration and collective action. But as @harrigan2020negative and others have pointed out, "some relationships harm. Others are characterised by avoidance, dislike, or conflict" (page 1). These negative ties are (hopefully) less common, but are disproportionately impactful in our lives. They also operate in ways in that are fundamentally different than positive ties. Networks that incorporate data on the positive and negative ties are called **signed graphs**, and are a major area of theoretical and methodological development in contemporary network analysis. 

Let's make two final distinctions. First, the network we are working with here is **unipartite**, which means there is only one type of node (people) and the matrix storing the data is square, with the same set of nodes in the rows and the columns. However, it is also possible to consider networks with two types of nodes, such as between people and organizational affiliations, or between people and events. This kind of network is **bipartite**, because there are two types of nodes, and the underlying matrix is a rectangular **incidence matrix** (or **affiliation matrix**) with one node type represented on the rows and the other in the columns. There are fascinating theoretical and methodological literatures on bipartite networks [for some foundational ideas, see @breiger1974duality; @mutzel2020duality], but regrettably we don't have the space to discuss bipartite networks here. 

Finally, the example we are working with is a **whole network**, in contrast to an **ego network**. As I mentioned, we can think of each node in a network as "ego" with a neighbourhood composed of their direct connections (alters). If the network data is collected to capture all of the relevant relationships within some **network boundary** (e.g. all students in a classroom), then we are working with a whole network, and the main data collection tasks include specifying the boundaries of the network (e.g., the classroom) within which we want to record relationships. If, however, we collect some sample of people and then collect data on their individual relationships, then we are working with a collection of **ego networks**, one for each node in the study. Ego networks, fascinating though they are, are also out of scope for this book. If you are interested in learning more about ego network analysis, I recommend @crossley2015social and @personal, as well as the 2020 special issue of *Network Science* on ego network analysis edited by @perry2020introduction.

## WORKING WITH RELATIONAL DATA

With these generalities out of the way, let's start getting into the details of working with relational data.

### Edgelists and Nodelists

As I mentioned earlier, matrices are the heart of network analysis, but they are not ideal ways to enter, store, or manage network data for anything other than small networks. In contemporary practice, most network data is stored in the form of **edgelists** and **nodelists**. In Figure @fig-14_03, the same relational data that is represented in the graph, and encoded in the adjacency matrix above, is encoded as an edgelist. The first two columns of the edgelist is where the relational data itself is stored. The columns are labelled source and target because the network is directed; the node in the `source` column sends an edge to the node in the `target` column.

![Cap](figures/edgelists.pdf)

While an edgelist only requires pairs of nodes, we can also include additional columns that provide data *about the relationship*. There is nothing special or unique about data that describes these edges except for the fact that they describe characteristics of the *relationship* between two entities rather than characteristics of the entities themselves. Just as we carefully specify variables for describing the attributes of entities, we can carefully specify variables for describing the attributes of relationships between entities. For example, we might have a variable that categorizes edges by the *type* of relationship (e.g., family, friend, foe, professional, romantic, people who dance together, people who do intravenous drugs with one another) or by it's sentiment (positive, neural, negative), to suggest just a couple of possibilities. Just as we can with an adjacency matrix, we can record edge weight (such as interaction frequency) as a variable in the edgelist. In longitudinal or dynamic networks (discussed in later chapters), we might also record the wave that a relationship was observed in, or perhaps a timestamp of when the interaction occurred (e.g., when Chen sent an email to Anvita). It may be a simple point, but it's very important to understand: we can record any empirical observations of the attributes of relationships. The same considerations about what to observe and record apply for edges as with nodes. There is nothing special about edge data except that it describes edges.



### NetworkX Graph Objects from Edgelists (and Matrices and More)

Let's examine some actual data. In the code block below, we will import a couple of packages and load up some relational data collected from a group of French high school students in 2013. This dataset is one of several collected by the SocioPatterns research team (with collaborators the ISI Foundation in Turin, the Centre de Physique Théorique in Marseille, and Bitmanufactory in Cambridge). The particular dataset we will use describes a network of face-to-face contacts between high school students in Marseille over a five-day period in December 2013. This data was collected via contact diaries, in which students recorded who they came into contact with (restricted to other students in the study) and for how long. Similar data was also collected with wearable sensors, but we will just focus on the contact diaries for now.

The edge data is provided in a CSV file with three columns: `i`, `j`, and `weight`. Physical co-presence is, of course, naturally undirected. It is not possible to be physically co-present with someone who is not also physically co-present with you. Therefore, the edgelist names the columns with `i` and `j` instead of `source` and `target`. This also means that a tie from `i` to `j` is the same as a tie from `j` to `i`. Finally, edge weight data is stored in the `weight` column and is coded as follows:

- `weight` = 1 if `i` and `j` were co-present for at most 5 minutes
- `weight` = 2 if `i` and `j` were co-present for 5-15 minutes
- `weight` = 3 if `i` and `j` were co-present for 15-60 minutes 
- `weight` = 4 if `i` and `j` were co-present for more than 60 minutes

We can load this edge data in a Pandas dataframe and perform any necessary cleaning before reading the edge data into the NetworkX package to create a graph object that we can analyze using network methods. 


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import networkx as nx
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns

from dcss import set_style, download_dataset

set_style()
```

```python
download_dataset(
    "https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/wbj6l2tyoc67o3vlonxp5/AERxFPRIhfgWG_MaVK_rjM4?rlkey=48x2taz2t5mru1j2ucjf670a8&st=e5qs5gw8&dl=0",
    save_path="data/SocioPatterns/"
)
```


```python
contact_diaries = pd.read_csv("data/SocioPatterns/Contact-diaries-network_data_2013.csv", sep=' ')
contact_diaries.head()
```


```python
contact_diaries.info()
```


All three columns in this data are numeric: the nodes in columns `i` and `j` are represented by numerical IDs rather than the names of the participants in the study. There are 502 rows in this edgelist, which means there are 502 observed edges.

We can import this weighted edgelist into the Python package NetworkX, which will transform our edge data into a graph object that we can analyze using methods and models from network analysis. NetworkX provides a number of useful functions for doing this. We'll use `from_pandas_edgelist()` because our data is stored in an edgelist format in a pandas dataframe. When we construct the network `G`, we'll provide NetworkX with the names of the columns that contain the IDs for each node in an edge. Any other columns in the dataframe will be treated as edge attribute data. Finally, we will also tell NetworkX that this is an *undirected* graph by passing the argument `create_using=nx.Graph()`. This tells NetworkX that, when it is creating the network, an edge from `i` to `j` is the same as an edge from `j` to `i`. If we were working with a *directed* network, we could pass the argument `create_using=nx.DiGraph()` instead.  

```python
G = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(contact_diaries, 'i', 'j', create_using=nx.Graph())
G.name = 'Reported Contacts (Diary Data)'
print(G)
```

You might be wondering why the number of rows in the edgelist differs from the number of edges in the network object `G`. The reason is because different students report the same relation. `i` might say they spent between 15 and 30 minutes with `j` and `j` might later report the same contact with `i`. However, it seems that not all students reported all interactions (if they had, we would expect there to be 502 reports of 251 edges). Because we believe that students are more likely to forget to record an interaction than they are to fabricate one in their contact diary, we **symmetrize** the relationship, making it undirected (if `i` spent time with `j`, then the reverse must necessarily be true). We have informed NetworkX that this network should use undirected edges by specifying a Graph object rather than a DiGraph (directed graph). 

Finally, before moving on, let's create a quick visualization of this network (Figure @fig-13_04). This is an inherently challenging task as networks are *very* high-dimensional objects and we are limited to 2 dimensions. It's best not to rely on visualizations such as these for any serious analytic work, but for relatively small networks they can still be informative. 


```python
layout = nx.nx_pydot.graphviz_layout(G)
```


```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 12))
nx.draw(G,
        pos=layout,
        node_color='gray',
        edge_color='lightgray',
        node_size=10,
        width=.5)
plt.savefig('figures/13_04.png', dpi=300)
```

![png](figures/13_04.png){#fig-13_04}
    
You'll see similar visualizations  one in the coming chapters. Each time you'll develop a deeper understanding of what to look for, such as clusters of densely connected nodes, or pendants hanging off a dense cluster of nodes at the **core** of a network. For now, let's keep moving.

NetworkX has a variety of functions for reading network data stored in other formats as well, and you can find the one that works with the your data's format by checking the documentation, which you can find at [https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/](https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/). Some of the formats supported at the time of writing include edgelists and matrices stored in Python's built in data structures (e.g., dictionaries) as well as numpy arrays and matrices, scipy matrices, and pandas dataframes. In addition to these edgelist and matrix data structures, NetworkX can also read and write network objects using file formats commonly used by other network analysis software, including graphml, GEXF, JSON, and Pajek files. Unless you are have a specific need for them, my recommendation is that you store your network data in the form of an edgelist and a nodelist in separate plain text CSV files. 

Now it's time to turn to some important building blocks of network analysis. We will start by briefly discussing the "walk-structure" of a network and the notion of network flow. This is intended to get you to start thinking about networks in a particular way in preparation for content that appears in the next chapter. We will then turn to some of the basic micro-level building blocks of network structure, dyads and triads. Together, these two final sections provide a foundation for much of what follows in later chapters.

## WALK-STRUCTURE AND NETWORK FLOW

One of the most foundational ideas in social network analysis is that your position in a network affects your ability to access or shape the **flow** of things -- such as resources, information, or knowledge -- through that network. Those things are often called **contagions**, or **social contagions**, even when they are not literally contagious in the way an infectious disease is (and most contagions that social scientists are interested in do *not* spread like infectious diseases, as you will learn in Chapter 18). Depending on where a node is positioned in the network, they can control or otherwise manipulate how a contagion is flowing through a network. For example, they may prevent someone from learning about some important information by feeding them incorrect information or by betraying their trust and spilling their secrets to the rest of the office. 

This notion of contagions *flowing* along the structure of a network enables disparate regions of that network to influence one another. In a friendship network, for example, we are influenced by our friends, by our friends' friends, by our friends' friends' friends, and so on. But exactly *how* does that happen, and to what degree? Which of the many possible paths do contagions flow on? All of them at once? Some subset of paths? If so, which ones? Perhaps a single *most optimal* one?

#### Walks, Trails, Paths, and Cycles

Earlier I mentioned that we would spin up a fictitious story about our five person network (Chen, Patrick, Anika, Anvita, and Nate). We'll do that now to help clarify some of the essential terminology, but we'll start with a slightly smaller version -- just Anika, Chen, and Patrick -- and then add the others in. 

Imagine a research lab with an upcoming team meeting with an ominous sounding item on the agenda. One member of the team, Chen, knows something about the context for this item and shares it with another member of the team, Patrick. In this scenario, Chen sends the information to Patrick (remember, this makes them *adjacent*). 

As we've discussed, nodes are also linked to other nodes *indirectly*. Let's say Chen's information came from another team member, Anika. Anika and Patrick are not adjacent, but they are indirectly connected via Chen. How can we describe this relationship? And why does it matter whether we describe it at all?

In network analysis, we are often interested in whether something (e.g., information about the ominous sounding agenda item) can travel from node $i$ (e.g., Anika) to node $j$ (e.g., Patrick). If it is indeed possible for that to happen, how many people would it have to go through to get there? And is there more than one way it might get there? If so, are some ways more efficient than others? If so, which ones? We can answer questions such as these about any nodes in a network by invoking the concept of a **walk**, which also provides both general and specific terminology for describing a wide variety of indirect relationships [@borgatti2020three]. Consider, the hypothetical network in Figure @fig-14_05, which we just described with words.

![Cap](figures/walks.pdf)

A *walk* is simply any sequence of adjacent nodes and edges that start with some node and end with a node. They can even start and end with the same node. In fact, the same node can appear in a walk more than once, and so can the same edges! In short, a walk is a very general way of describing *any* way that you can go from one node to another by "walking" along the edges, even if what you want to do is get back to where you started. There are no restrictions provided the edges to walk on actually exist (or rather, are observed). This opens all kinds of useful ways of thinking about the *distances* between nodes, operationalized in terms of lengths of walks, which is defined in terms of the number of edges contained in the walk. In the above network, the walk from Anika to Patrick passes through 1 node, Chen, but has a length of 2 because it consists of the relationship between Anika and Chen, and between Chen and Patrick (2 edges).

Let's complicate this just a wee bit by introducing a few additional team members, our fictitious friends Anvita and Nate. Chen, especially anxious about the ominous agenda item, shares the information with Anvita and Nate. Anvita doesn't know Patrick already knows, so shares the information with Patrick. Patrick doesn't know the information ultimately came from Anika, so sends the information back to Anika. Nate prefers not to pass the information along because they aren't sure how credible it really is. Figure @fig-14_06 shows the structure of this network with the new information sharing relations. Note that you can't read this representation left to right! The information flow process started with Anika in this hypothetical example.

![Cap](figures/walks_2.pdf)

Our initial walk from Anika to Patrick still exists, of course, but now we also have the possibility of many other walks. Anika to Chen to Nate is a walk. Anika to Chen to Anvita to Patrick and back to Anika is a walk. More specifically it is a **closed walk** because it starts and ends with the same node: Anika. 

In empirical networks, the number of possible walks between any pair of nodes can be vast, but we can impose some order by grouping them into different *kinds* of walks, such as trails, paths, and cycles. A **trail** is type of walk where *edges* are not allowed to repeat themselves. For example, Anika to Chen to Anvita to Patrick to Anika is a trail but the exact same walk would *not* be a trail if we included another step to Chen (as that would be repeating an edge). The length of a trail is equal to the number of edges contained in the trail, which in the example above would be 4. A **path** is a type of walk where *nodes* are not allowed to be repeated. That means that the trail from Anika to Chen to Anvita to Patrick to Anika is *not* a path, because Anika is repeated twice, but Anika to Chen to Anvita to Patrick is. As with trails, the length of a path is equal to the number of edges it contains. Finally, **cycles** are types of closed walks that (a) involve a minimum of three nodes where the only node that is repeated is the node that starts and ends the walk, and (b) no edges are repeated. There are many other specific types of walks that we will not discuss here. For directed networks, the three-node minimum may be relaxed if you have two nodes that send an edge to each other. This is sometimes called a **trivial cycle** and its status as a cycle or not should depend on *why* you care about cycles. 

All of these examples are walks. Some of those walks are trails, and some of those trails are paths and others are cycles. *If there is a path between two nodes*, say between Anika and Nate, then we say that those two are **reachable**. 

In connected networks, there are typically *many* possible paths that connect any given pair of nodes in a network, but they are not all equally efficient. While information and other resources can certainly travel through a network via inefficient routes, the likelihood of actually going the distance is much greater when traveling on efficient paths. For that reason, we are commonly interested in focusing on the **shortest paths** between nodes. We will spend a good amount of time in the next chapter discussing shortest paths, followed by a discussion of some alternative assumptions about how contagions flow in a network.

We will leave our discussion of walk-structures for now. The key thing to emphasize right now is the general logic of traversing a social network this way, and to understand that the structure of the network affects the flow of contagions through it, meaning people in the network will be differentially exposed to those contagions, good or bad. We will return to this issue in the next chapter. For now, let's turn to the some micro building blocks of network structure.

<p>This chapter focuses on “centrality analysis,” which is widely-used for analyzing social networks with an emphasis on influence, inequality, status, dependence, and power (among many other things). The literature on social networks contains a huge number of centrality measures, each designed to operationalize and measure some specific theoretical idea. It’s not possible to cover all of them here, nor especially desirable. I will cover two important frameworks for thinking about centrality. For each framework, I will describe some of the most foundational centrality measures, and clarify the connections between these empirical measures and their conceptual and theoretical underpinnings. This should help you develop a good understanding of centrality <em>in general</em> so you can make sense of other centralities.</p>
<p>This chapter is organized into three main sections. The first section begins with a brief high-level discussion of centrality. I then introduce the first centrality framework: a “central” node describes a network position that has more influence over the flow of things through the network. This perspective is anchored in ideas of “walks” on a network and “contagions” that “flow” through those walks, two ideas that were briefly introduced in the previous chapter. The second section of this chapter builds up an intuitive understanding of these concepts and culminates in a discussion of “shortest path betweenness centrality” and “current flow betweenness centrality.”</p>
<p>The third section addresses the second centrality framework, which ultimately boil down to counting connections, the sum of which is known as a node’s “degree.” At the most basic level, nodes that are connected to many other nodes (high degree) are more popular than nodes with few relationships (low degree). This simple idea is the foundation of more complex ideas. For example, the popularity of the nodes that one is connected to also matters, and because of the structure of social networks this idea expands out to include all reachable nodes in a network. In other words, being connected to a small to moderate number of very well-connected nodes can unlock more advantages in a network than being connected to a very large number of nodes who are not themselves well-connected (e.g.&nbsp;it’s probably better to have 20 friends who each have 5 friends than to have 100 friends who are only connected to you). This is will lead us to eigenvector centrality and its close relation Bonacich power centrality.</p>
<p>These different ways of thinking about – and operationalizing – influence, inequality, status, dependence, and power came from researchers studying different networks in a wide array of contexts. A centrality measure developed to measure the influence in a friendship network may not translate well to measuring influence in an information brokerage network. As <span class="citation" data-cites="kitts2014beyond">Kitts (<a href="references.html#ref-kitts2014beyond" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> has argued, a common problem with centrality analysis is that researchers implicitly assume there is some inherent meaning behind specific centrality measures that holds up regardless of the type of relationships that are operationalized as the edges of a network. In fact, the interpretation of a measure depends as much on the nature of the relations measured than it does on the mathematics of the measure itself <span class="citation" data-cites="kitts2020rethinking">(see also <a href="references.html#ref-kitts2020rethinking" role="doc-biblioref">Kitts and Quintane 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>As always, we’re just scratching the surface of what is possible here, but if you really understand the conceptual basis of these measures and how they are computed from network data, you’ll have a solid foundation for learning about other centrality measures.</p>

<p>A node’s location in a social network matters. It determines what they are exposed to; the support, opportunities, and resources they have access to; their social status and prestige; and their ability to exercise power and influence over others. In network science, centrality measures are one of the main ways in which abstract concepts such as these are mapped onto concrete measurable variables that can be computed from relational data.</p>
<p>Consider power. Like many other social scientific approaches to conceptualizing power, the network perspective is relational. It emphasizes relationships and situations where one person is dependent upon another, with the assumption that these dependency relations determine consequential things in our lives, both good and bad. We are embedded in a complex intersection of many such relationships, regardless of how aware we are of the dependency dynamics. To name just a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>a child or young adult who depends upon a parent for <em>everything</em>;</li>
<li>a graduate student who depends upon a supervisor’s expertise, support, and connections;</li>
<li>an academic department chair whose approval or disapproval partially determines a faculty member’s performance evaluations and salary increases (in a non-unionized context); or</li>
<li>a friend who depends upon another friend for support in a crisis.</li>
</ul>
<p>These dependency relations can, of course, be exploited. Parents can be unloving, and physically or emotionally abusive. Supervisors can be take credit for work. Department chairs can be jealous, or petty, and favour others. Friends can take advantage of us.</p>
<p>In these cases, one person has asymmetric control and power in the relationship. They can impose their will and make life better or worse for the dependent individual. The point is <em>outcomes for ego, such as health and wellbeing, are at least partially in the hands of alter</em>. But it’s not just about one-to-one relationships, and this is one of the critical reasons for thinking about these dependency relations in the context of larger networks of relations, not just dyads.</p>
<p>If a student can jump ship and find a better supervisor, if a friend can turn to another friend, if a faculty member can be evaluated by committee rather than by a department chair, then the dependency is lessened and power is less concentrated. Children and adults in toxic and abusive relationships are more obviously constrained in their ability to reduce their dependencies. Children don’t get to choose their parents and there are most certainly specific reasons why people are prevented from leaving toxic and abusive relationships. The structure of social networks can constrain people in comparable ways, making it difficult to break free from the control of others. This is further complicated by the fact that most of us don’t <em>really</em> know all that much about the structure of the networks that we live our lives in. As <span class="citation" data-cites="hanneman2005introduction">Hanneman and Riddle (<a href="references.html#ref-hanneman2005introduction" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span> put it so pithily, “ego’s power is alter’s dependence.”</p>
<p>This insight has profound implications. The structural properties of a social network determine the amount of power available in general, its distribution among nodes, and therefore the extent to which some nodes can influence others. In some networks, power may be relatively evenly distributed and opportunities for control and domination are rare. In others, it may be centralized around a small subset of nodes. In other words, the structure of our social networks determine the extent to which we are <em>able</em> to influence and control one another, with some network structures enabling more influence and control and others enabling less. We can change lives <em>dramatically</em>, for better or for worse, by changing the structure of dependency relations.</p>
<p>Centrality analysis provides tools we can use to examine power empirically via dependency relations, but this is only one possibility. Centrality analysis can be used to assess the opportunities and constraints for any node, given the specific ways they connect to other nodes in a network, which we can refer to as a node’s “position.”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Some positions may be more or less likely to result in exposure to novel information and ideas, or they may afford easy access to elites or resources that are more difficult for others in less advantageous positions to access.</p>
<p>There are various centrality measures designed to capture these differences and others. At this point it’s important to note:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Being central is not <em>inherently</em> good or desirable. The same types of central positions that give one early access to useful information can also mean early exposure to infectious diseases.<br>
</li>
<li>Being central is not a guarantee that a node will experience the hypothesized effects of their position, good or bad. Having the opportunity to access elites is not the same thing as seizing that opportunity.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are usually specific types of structural positions that you expect to be important given your research question. As always, <em>theory is really important here</em>. Rather than computing every centrality score, you should select those that correspond to your research question or operationalize a relevant concept. You may want to identify information brokers in a collaboration network. This could help you study whether people who are in a position to influence the flow of information over walks (a concept we will turn to momentarily) in the collaboration network have different career outcomes than those who are not in such positions, or perhaps find key individuals in a needle sharing network for a public health intervention. In that case, you could use betweenness centrality, which we discuss shortly. While you certainly should analyze multiple centralities, you need to think deeply about the question you are trying to answer, what these specific centralities mean and how they work, and how well those align.</p>

<p>The first framework for thinking about centrality is interested in the access that a node has to the rest of the network. It’s probably intuitive that the most efficient way to exchange something (information, resources, power) between two points is to find the shortest distance between them (i.e.&nbsp;the path between two nodes that involves the smallest number of nodes and edges). Those “shortest paths” are also called <strong>geodesics</strong>.</p>
<p>We can identify the <em>shortest</em> path between any two nodes using the <code>shortest_path()</code> function in NetworkX. If we use the function without specifying a specific pair of nodes, it will compute all of the shortest paths between every possible start and end point between every pair of nodes in a network. Even for small networks, that’s a <em>lot</em> of paths.</p>
<p>To help build some intuition about paths, we will define a couple of functions that will let us quickly query the paths between any pair of nodes, and then highlight those paths in simple network visualizations. Note that we are constructing our visualizations a little differently than we did in the last chapter.</p>
<p>Our <code>plot_path()</code> function requires a layout for the network visualization. We will use the <code>kamada_kawai_layout()</code> function to compute the layout for a visualization of the contact diary network data from SocioPatterns, which we used to construct the network object <code>G</code> at the start of this chapter.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>layout <span class="op">=</span> nx.kamada_kawai_layout(G)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
<p>The nodes in the SocioPatterns data are, of course, anonymized. The research team assigned each node an integer ID. You can see those IDs with <code>G.nodes()</code>.</p>
<p>Now that we have our functions defined, and we know what the IDs are for the nodes in our network, let’s look at a few examples. We will provide our <code>get_shortest_paths()</code> function with the integer IDs for our source and target nodes. For example, let’s find the shortest path between node <code>173</code> and node <code>48</code>.</p>

<p>In order for some information that <code>173</code> has to reach <code>48</code> along the shortest path, it would have to first go through nodes <code>295</code>, <code>954</code>, and so on.

<p>Notice that in these shortest paths that <em>start</em> with <code>173</code> and <em>end</em> with <code>48</code>, there are some nodes that appear on <em>all</em> the shortest paths, such as <code>295</code> and <code>954</code>. This enables us to count the number of shortest paths that involve any given node. Nodes that are involved in a larger number of shortest paths may be considered more central, as being involved in more shortest paths offers some distinct advantages for power and influence.</p>
<p>Let’s plot all of these paths (Figure <a href="#fig-15_02">Figure&nbsp;<span>13.2</span></a>).</p>

<p>Shortest path lengths can also be computed, which can be useful when the <strong>distance</strong> between two nodes matters more than the specific paths connecting them. We can do this with the <code>shortest_path_length()</code> function. Recall from earlier that we are counting <em>edges</em> on a path between a source and target node, so the length will always be equal to 1 - the number of nodes in the path itself. This can be useful to know because information and influence usually degrade over longer distances. That’s why shorter paths are likely to be more important than longer ones. The <code>shortest_path_length()</code> function tells us that, regardless of the specific path, the closest that <code>173</code> and <code>48</code> can be is 10 steps.</p>
<p>Sometimes, depending on the network and the data, edges might vary in length, which can be encoded as edge weights. In these cases, the number of edges between two nodes is no longer the best measure of distance. Thankfully, many algorithms, like shortest paths, can take these weights into consideration. We will see an example of an algorithm that accounts for edge weight shortly when we discuss current flow betweenness centrality.</p>

<p>Finally, we can also compute the average length shortest paths in a connected network using the <code>average_shortest_paths()</code> function. This is an average across <em>all pairs</em> of <span class="math inline">\(i,j\)</span> nodes in the full network.</p>

<p>This discussion of paths and network walk-structure has been building a foundation for our discussion of betweenness centrality. In brief, the idea is that nodes that lie <strong>between</strong> nodes, or better yet, between groups of densely connected nodes (a concept we will turn to in the next chapter), often have advantages and opportunities that other nodes do not have. For example, information tends to be more homogenous within clusters of densely connected nodes and more diverse across such clusters. As a result, nodes that are embedded <em>within</em> a cluster tend not to have information that is unknown to their adjacent peers, but nodes that lie <em>between</em> clusters get access to diverse sources of information. In some cases, these nodes may be able to influence and perhaps even control the flow of information through the network. For example, they may filter and frame information in ways that increase their own power over others who depend on them for access to that information. In other words, they are in potential <strong>brokerage</strong> positions. Consider the hypothetical network in Figure <a href="#fig-15_03">Figure&nbsp;<span>13.3</span></a>. Which node is the in-between broker? If we consider the shortest paths in this network, which nodes will be on more shortest paths than others?</p>

<p>There are two main ways of computing betweenness centrality: shortest path and current flow. As you might expect, <strong>shortest path betweenness</strong> is computed based on shortest paths, which are central to the any process where a contagion (e.g.&nbsp;information) spreads through a network.</p>
<p>To compute shortest path betweenness for any given node, we first determine the shortest paths between every pair of nodes in the network. We then compute the proportion of shortest paths that include the node in question for each <span class="math inline">\(i,j\)</span> pair of nodes in the network. Those proportions are then summed to obtain a single number. If a node does not lie on <em>any</em> shortest paths, then its betweenness score will be 0 (e.g.&nbsp;if it is an isolate). It will have the maximum value if it lies on <em>all</em> shortest paths between <em>all</em> pairs of nodes in the network. Note that this is a systematic implementation of the general idea we considered earlier when noting that some nodes lie on more shortest paths than others.</p>
<p>Let’s quickly visualize the distribution of betweenness scores with a histogram (Figure <a href="#fig-15_04">Figure&nbsp;<span>13.4</span></a>).</p>

<p>Most nodes in the network have low shortest path betweenness; only a few have higher scores.</p>
<p>Unlike shortest paths betweenness, <strong>current flow betweenness</strong> takes into account the strength of relationships when it conceptualizes how a contagion flows through a network. Current flow betweenness draws on the analogy of electrical current flowing through a <em>resistance network</em>, where edges are resistors. A detailed discussion of electromagnetism is beyond the scope of this book, so we will gloss over the details and focus on some quick takeaways.</p>
<p>A circuit where resistors are arranged in a single line between the source and the target is a series circuit. The current can only flow through one path, so the current is the same between each node on the path between the source and the target. The <em>effective resistance</em> of the circuit is the sum of the resistances of all the resistors. Thus, for a given path, adding another edge at the end can only increase the effective resistance: information flows less well through longer chains. Consider the flow of people leaving a crowded stadium. This stadium is poorly designed and everyone has to leave via a single path consisting of a series of rooms. Each time you add a room, you add a door that has to be opened, you give people more chances to stumble, and generally the whole flow of people from the stadium (source) to the exit (target) will slow down.</p>
<p>A circuit where resistors are arranged such that multiple paths lie between the source and the target is a parallel circuit. The current will split where paths branch and flow down each of the possible paths, with more current flowing through more efficient paths. As you add parallel resistors, the effective resistance of the whole circuit decreases. Consider the stadium example: if we have multiple exits, people will be leaving through all of them. Some exits will be more efficient because they have fewer rooms and/or larger doors, and people will flow through those faster. If you add another exit, even if it’s a small side door, people will necessarily be able to leave faster. In current flow betweenness, the strength of a relationship corresponds to how efficient the flow of current is between nodes. In our example, rooms with larger doorways between them could be represented with greater edge weights.</p>
<p>This example sounds like a directed network, but the network we are working with is undirected. To calculate the circuit flow betweenness of a node, we consider that each node in the network could be a source or a target, and calculate the current flow for that node averaged across every possible pairing of source and target nodes. Bringing it back to the stadium example, this is like shuffling the stadium seats and the stadium exit through all the rooms so that we consider every possible pairing and take the average flow through a room across all those pairings.</p>
<p>The code below computes current flow betweenness and then constructs a scatterplot (Figure <a href="#fig-15_05">Figure&nbsp;<span>13.5</span></a>) to compare the scores against the shortest path version.</p>

<p>While similar, the two measures are not equivalent to one another. At very low values, shortest path betweenness and current flow betweenness are quite densely clustered and the relationship between the two seems stronger, but as we look at the larger (and rarer) values, the relationship becomes much weaker. Consider why this might be. Being on a single shortest path will necessarily have a low shortest path and low current flow betweenness score because the flow of contagion/current can only be a small amount of the larger network. However, as we increase the number of shortest paths that a node is on, we are also increasing the chances of a node being part of a parallel circuits (metaphorically speaking). Current flow betweenness conceptualizes that flow between nodes take the routes other than the shortest path, albeit at a reduced rate. Thus, we would likely expect a wider distribution of current flow betweenness values.</p>
<p>Let’s move on from the idea of things flowing through a network and consider another way of thinking about centrality.</p>

<h2 data-number="13.7" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="popularity-power-and-influence"><span class="header-section-number">13.7</span> POPULARITY, POWER, AND INFLUENCE</h2>
<p>The second centrality framework is focused less on the ideas of paths and flow, and more on popularity, status, and prestige. The idea is that more – and “better” – relationships are associated with greater popularity, status, and prestige.</p>
<p>To demonstrate this, let’s work with another network dataset collected from the same French high school students by the SocioPatterns team. The previous network represented reported <em>contacts</em> that we coerced into an undirected network. This network is a directed friendship network produced by students identifying other students as their friends. Unfortunately, some friendships are asymmetrical; one may feel the relationship is strong enough to nominate the other, but it may not be reciprocated. For this, we will use a DiGraph (directed graph).</p>

<p>One of the most critical pieces of information in this approach to centrality is the number of connections a node has. For an undirected network, that count is called <strong>degree</strong>. If I have 50 connections my degree is 50. Nodes with higher degree are, by definition, more connected. For a directed network, we distinguish between edges leaving a node, <em>out-degree</em>, and edges arriving at a node, <em>in-degree</em>. In a hypothetical advice network at a business where a directed edge represents “gave advice to”, we would expect the most senior and experienced employees to have higher out-degree (they are giving advice to more people) and the most junior would have higher in-degree (they are receiving from more people). While an individual node can have different in-degree and out-degree, the network <em>as a whole</em> will have a balanced in-degree and out-degree because each directed edge is necessarily an outgoing <em>and</em> an incoming edge for two different nodes. We can still use the concept of degree for directed networks, simply by adding a node’s in-degree and out-degree to count all edges connected to a node.</p>
<p>Let’s compute the out and in-degrees for the nodes in the SocioPatterns contact network. Then we’ll visualize the network a couple of times, once with the node sizes as a function of indegree and once as a function of outdegree. Since we intend to execute the visualization code a couple of times, let’s define a custom function.</p>

<p>If you squint, you might notice some apparent differences in the popularity (indegree) and activity (outdegree) across nodes in the network, but for the most part it seems as if the nodes that have higher indegree also have higher outdegree.

<p>Recall we are working with reported friendships, where outdegree means that one node, <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, has nominated another node, <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, as a friend. If <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> are indeed friends, then they should both nominate each other. (<em>Reciprocity!</em>) It follows that in a network such as this one, nodes that have a high score on one of the two degree measures will likely also have a high score on the other. The network visualizations and the scatterplot clearly suggests that there are some high-activity students who both nominated, and were nominated by more people, and while closely related, it is also clear that in-degree and out-degree are not equal for all students. Not every friendship in this network was reciprocated.</p>

<h4 data-number="13.7.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="connection-inequality"><span class="header-section-number">13.7.1.1</span> Connection Inequality</h4>
<p>Inequalities in connectedness, visible as inequalities in node in-/out-/degree, can have many consequences. We are often concerned with extreme levels of inequality, which in network science are analyzed in terms of cumulative advantage processes – the rich get richer, the more well-connected become more connected <span class="citation" data-cites="merton1968matthew barabasi1999emergence price1965networks price1986little diprete2006cumulative">(<a href="references.html#ref-merton1968matthew" role="doc-biblioref">Merton 1968</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-barabasi1999emergence" role="doc-biblioref">Barabási and Albert 1999</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-price1965networks" role="doc-biblioref">Price 1965</a>, <a href="references.html#ref-price1986little" role="doc-biblioref">1986</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-diprete2006cumulative" role="doc-biblioref">DiPrete and Eirich 2006</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Even moderate levels of inequality can have surprising effects, however. Consider what Scott <span class="citation" data-cites="feld1991your">Feld (<a href="references.html#ref-feld1991your" role="doc-biblioref">1991</a>)</span> has called “<strong>the friendship paradox</strong>,” which states: on average, people’s friends have more friends than they do (on average, people have fewer friends than their friends do). To demonstrate, consider the following: a person (ego) has 20 friends (alters) who each have 10 friends. As a consequence of this inequality, every alter has a below-average number of friends. This connection inequality in personal networks can impact how we perceive the world around us and what we judge to be “normal.” Although they are a minority overall, the most well-connected people are over-represented in most people’s personal networks, and everyone else, though quantitatively more common, are under-represented in other people’s networks <span class="citation" data-cites="feld1991your">(<a href="references.html#ref-feld1991your" role="doc-biblioref">Feld 1991</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The preferences and behaviours of the most popular people are more visible in our lives than those of their underrepresented peers. As a result, our personal connections are rarely a good indication of the types of preferences and behaviours that are more common in the general population because the most well-connected are disproportionately represented. In other words, our everyday perceptions of what is “normal” are biased.</p>
<p>Let’s use degree as a measure of popularity for now, though in-degree may also be suitable. We can visualize connection inequalities by plotting the <strong>degree distribution</strong>. In Figure <span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?fig-15_09</span>, we see the number of nodes (<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis) with each possible degree value (<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis).</p>

<p>Because there is often a lot of inequality in connectedness, especially in larger networks, it is often more informative to plot the degree distribution with both axes on a log scale. If the result is a relatively straight negative line from the upper right to the bottom left, you might want to formally check for a power law distribution, which would indicate extreme inequality and potentially some sort of cumulative advantage process.</p>
<p>Another way of inspecting the degree distribution is to produce a plot that ranks nodes based on their degree and plots their rank and degree on a log-log scale (Figure <span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?fig-15_10</span>). The top <em>ranked</em> node in the graph is shown in the upper left of the graph (at <span class="math inline">\(10^{0}\)</span>, which is 1). As you would expect, nodes in this upper left corner have higher degree centrality than any other nodes in the network (27). We see the decreasing degree of each successive node in the ranked list as we move along the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis. As we get towards the end of the list, we start to see nodes with very low degree. As there are no isolates in this network, the lowest degree score is 1 (or <span class="math inline">\(10^{0}\)</span>).</p>

<p>Degree is commonly treated as a proxy for “popularity,” but that’s not the only option. Our interpretation of any centrality measure <em>must be based on the type of ties in the network</em>. In the earlier example of the contact diary network, the edges in the network simply indicate whether two nodes came into contact with each other within a given time frame. One could make an argument for “popularity” there, but it would make more sense to think of degree in the contact network as something like mobility: moving more may produce more opportunities for contact. Returning to the idea of contagions flowing through a network, degree could be a measure for exposure, with more connections indicating more exposure. The specific details of the relations encoded in the network matter as much, or more than, the formal mathematics of the measure when it comes to interpreting centrality.</p>

<p>Degree centrality is an intuitive way of thinking about how connected people are, but analytically it doesn’t get us very far on its own. However, many other centrality measures are built on degree, and can be used to operationalize more complex and interesting ideas. <strong>Eigenvector centrality</strong> is based on the simple idea that being connected to well-connected people matters: even if your degree doesn’t change, if your neighbour’s degree increases, your connection to the network also increases.</p>
<p>Consider our friendship network again. This time we are going to look at the “<strong>neighborhoods</strong>” (immediate alters) of two specific nodes and their extended neighbourhoods (alters’ alters). I will pick two focal nodes, <code>1519</code> and <code>196</code> and assign them the color crimson. Their immediate alters will be plotted in black, their extended neighbourhood in dark gray, and the rest of the nodes light gray. I have chosen these two nodes to compare because they have the same degree (the size of their immediate neighbourhoods are identical).</p>
<p>We’ll use the <code>plot_nodes()</code> function defined below to simplify some of the visualization code. The resulting plots is shown in Figures <span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?fig-15_11</span> and <a href="#fig-15_12">Figure&nbsp;<span>13.12</span></a>.</p>

<p>Despite their immediate neighbourhoods (black) being the same size, <code>196</code> has much greater reach with their extended neighbourhood because their immediate neighbours are better connected.</p>
<p>Think about <em>influence</em> in this context. <code>196</code> influences and is influenced by their direct alters, who in turn influence and are influenced by <em>their</em> direct alters. Influence on <code>196</code> is most strong from their immediate alters, followed by their alters’ alters, followed by her alters’ alters’ alters, and so on.</p>
<p>Let’s consider how this is reflected in eigenvector centrality. Technically, a node’s eigenvector centrality is proportional to the sum of the centralities of their alters <span class="citation" data-cites="borgatti2018analyzing">(<a href="references.html#ref-borgatti2018analyzing" role="doc-biblioref">Borgatti, Everett, and Johnson 2018</a>)</span>. In this sense eigenvector centrality can also be interpreted as a measure of popularity, but it differs from degree centrality because a node can have high eigenvector centrality but low degree centrality (i.e., they are connected to only a few people, but those people are well-connected).</p>
<p>Both <code>1519</code> and <code>196</code> have degrees of 11 (5 reciprocated nominations and one unreciprocated), but when we look at the network we can probably intuit that they occupy different types of positions given <em>who</em> they are connected to, and how those people are connected. Just by eyeballing the network, we can see that <code>196</code>’s connections are more connected than <code>1519</code>’s are. When it comes to <em>influence</em> and <em>power</em> in a network, being connected to well-connected people is more useful than being connected to less well-connected people.</p>
<p>Eigenvector centrality is based on this fundamental idea that, when it comes to influence, the connections of the people we are connected to matter. We have to think, and “see” beyond our immediate social neighborhoods.</p>

<p>We can see that degree and eigenvector centrality are somewhat positively correlated. As degree increases, eigenvector tends to increase as well, though some individuals with high degree centrality are especially well-positioned and take a lion’s share of the eigenvector centrality.</p>

<h3 data-number="13.7.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bonacich-power-centrality"><span class="header-section-number">13.7.3</span> Bonacich Power Centrality</h3>
<p>Eigenvector centrality is often used, among other things, as a proxy for power. However, as Phillip <span class="citation" data-cites="bonacich1987power">Bonacich (<a href="references.html#ref-bonacich1987power" role="doc-biblioref">1987</a>)</span> pointed out, being more “central” is not necessarily the same thing as being more powerful. Being connected to well-connected others makes you more reachable, <em>but less powerful</em>, because the people you are connected to are connected to many others; they do not <em>depend</em> on you because they have alternative connections. On the other hand, if the people you are connected to are <em>not</em> themselves well-connected, then their connection to you matters more; they are more dependent on you, and therefore you are more powerful. For Bonacich, then, ego is more central when their alters are densely connected with one another, but this makes ego <em>less</em> powerful; instead, ego gains power when their alters have few connections to others.</p>
<p>We might expect to see this in access and exchange networks, where being connected to people who have a lot of other exchange partners reduces your “bargaining power.” Being connected to people who have few exchange partners, on the other hand, increases your bargaining power. Bonacich power centrality conceptualizes power in terms of an ego’s access to alters who are dependent on them.</p>
<p>Bonacich power centrality introduces an <strong>attenuation factor</strong> – the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> – that controls how a node’s centrality is influenced by the centralities of its alters. <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> can be positive or negative, reflecting different notions of power and centrality. For example, a <strong>positive <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span></strong> indicates that being connected to well-connected alters increases your centrality. This is similar to the idea of eigenvector centrality, where centrality flows through well-connected nodes. A <strong>negative <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span></strong> indicates that being connected to poorly connected alters increases your power. This captures the idea that you are more powerful when your alters depend on you because they lack alternative connections. Finally, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> of <strong>zero</strong> indicates that the centrality of a node is independent of the centralities of its alters, effectively reducing Bonacich centrality to degree centrality.</p>
<p>In this way, Bonacich power centrality is a flexible measure that can capture different dimensions of centrality and power depending on the value of <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. However, this flexibility comes with the need to carefully choose an appropriate <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> value, or range or <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> values. Importantly, not all values of <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> are valid for a given network. The attenuation factor <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> must be within certain bounds to ensure that the centrality calculation is mathematically valid and numerically stable.</p>
<section id="valid-ranges-of-beta" class="level4" data-number="13.7.3.1">
<h4 data-number="13.7.3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="valid-ranges-of-beta"><span class="header-section-number">13.7.3.1</span> Valid Ranges of <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span></h4>
<p>Computing Bonacich power centrality involves inverting the matrix <span class="math inline">\((I - \beta A)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is the identity matrix and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the adjacency matrix of the network. For the inverse <span class="math inline">\((I - \beta A)^{-1}\)</span> to exist, the matrix <span class="math inline">\((I - \beta A)\)</span> must be invertible, which depends on the eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>For <strong>positive attenuation factors</strong>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> must be less than the absolute value of the recipricol of the largest eigenvalue of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\beta &lt; \frac{1}{\lambda_{\text{max}}}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{\text{max}}\)</span> is the largest eigenvalue of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>For <strong>negative attenuation factors</strong>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> must be greater than the recipricol of the smallest eigenvalue of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\beta &gt; \frac{1}{\lambda_{\text{min}}}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{\text{min}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>These upper and lower bounds ensure that the matrix <span class="math inline">\((I - \beta A)\)</span> is invertible, thereby avoiding issues with singularity and numerical instability.</p>
<p>Choosing a single <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> parameter within these bounds can be challenging, but that is not what we want to do in practice. Instead, we want to explore a range of <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> values to understand how the centrality measures change.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Bonacich power centrality is not implemented in NetworkX, graph-tool, or igraph for Python. However, I’ve implemented it in the networks module of the dcss package. It correctly handles the attenuation factor <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> and the necessary bounds by default.</p>
<p>Let’s compute Bonacich power centrality scores for a network constructed from the SocioPatterns contact diary data.</p>

<p>These scatter plots reveal how the relationship between degree centrality and Bonacich power centrality changes as <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> varies. At <span class="math inline">\(\beta = 0\)</span>, Bonacich power centrality reduces to degree centrality, which is reflected in the perfect linear relationship in the corresponding subplot, where each node’s power centrality score is directly proportional to its normalized degree centrality. For positive <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> values, the centrality scores begin to emphasize nodes connected to well-connected alters. The correlation with degree centrality remains positive, but with more dispersion. Nodes with high degree centrality connected to other well-connected nodes may have disproportionately higher power centrality scores.</p>
<p>The relationship between degree centrality and power centrality changes considerably for negative <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> values. As Bonacich argued should be the case, nodes connected to poorly connected alters have higher power centrality scores. The scatter plots show negative trends, highlighting how nodes with lower degree centrality have higher power centrality, due to their alters’ dependence on them.</p>
<p>To deepen our understanding of how the attenuation factor <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> influences the Bonacich power centrality scores, let’s visualize the network graphs with nodes sized and colored according to their power centrality scores for each <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> value. Figure <span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?fig-15_bpc_networks</span> presents a series of network visualizations (small multiples), each corresponding to a different <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> value.</p>

<p>Figure <span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?fig-15_bpc_networks</span> reveals a few notable patterns.</p>
<p>As previously noted, at <span class="math inline">\(\beta = 0\)</span> (all purple nodes), the node sizes and colors reflect degree centrality. As <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> increases to positive values, nodes that are connected to well-connected alters have higher centrality. As such, nodes in densely connected clusters become larger and more prominently colored. This effect is similar to eigenvector centrality, where being connected to highly central nodes increases one’s own centrality. The visualizations show centrality clustering in densely connected parts of the network.</p>
<p>As <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> decreases to negative values, the centrality scores highlight nodes connected to poorly connected alters. Nodes that serve as bridges to less-connected parts of the network become more central. In the visualizations, some previously large nodes shrink relative to their neighbors, while nodes connected to less-connected alters increase in size. This reflects the concept that power can come from brokering alters who lack alternative connections.</p>
<p>These graphs shed light on how the attenuation factor, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, affects what we learn about power and centrality in a network through the lens of Bonacich’s power centrality. As always, the choice of <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> should align with the theoretical considerations of power and influence in the specific research context, and should always consider a range of parameter values.</p>

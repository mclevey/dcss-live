# Supervised Machine Learning

::: {.callout-warning}
## Planned Revisions

This chapter will introduce ML with an emphasis on supervised learning. Dropping the connectionist paradigm until later in the book. Adding the generative / statistical?

The revised chapter will incorporate some content from the chapter on regression and classification. The examples in that chapter will be changed to text data. I plan to do this in a way that reflect the distinction between discovery and supervision in the text as data book. Of course, cross-validation will be part of that.

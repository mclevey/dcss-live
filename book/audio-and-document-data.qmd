# Audio and document data

::: {.callout-warning}

## Coming Soon!

This is a new chapter. I am actively working on it in fall 2024 and intend to publish a working draft in early winter 2025. It will include using some deep learning models for the audio and document data, so I need to think about how best to integrate the chapter this early in the book, long before deep learning is introduced. Stay tuned! ðŸ˜Ž

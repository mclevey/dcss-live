# Audio, image, and document data

::: {.callout-warning}
## In Development

This is a ✨new✨ chapter. It's currently in development and will likely be ready for distribution by the end of 2024. It includes some deep learning models for the audio and document data, so I need to think about how best to integrate the chapter this early in the book, long before deep learning is introduced.

## Image Data

- How deep do I want to do here?

## Document Data

- PDFs
    - Older tools
    - Deep learning models (including images)

## In Progress

This is a "[shitty first draft](https://www.amazon.ca/Bird-Some-Instructions-Writing-Life/dp/0385480016)," with some sections being shittier than others. Normally I wouldn't share work so early in it's development, but I'm interested in your feedback. Feel free to skim, but know that I am actively developing this chapter and it will be going through some very extensive changes in the coming weeks.

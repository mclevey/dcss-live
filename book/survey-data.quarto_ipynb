        "It's time to shift from using Python as a general programming language to using it to process data using specialized data management and analysis packages. We are going to rely primarily on two packages from a collection of packages widely referred to as Python's \"scientific stack.\" The first is Pandas, which was created by Wes McKinney for analyzing **pan**el **da**ta (hence the name). It comes with special data structures, functions, and methods that you can use to take care of the vast majority of data processing operations for structured quantitative data. The second is Numpy, which is a lower-level package for efficient computation and maths. Numpy is the foundation that many other packages, including Pandas, are built on. We're not going to cover Numpy in any significant detail here, but it's worth knowing that Numpy provides arrays of arbitrary size and dimensionality, and is one of the pillars upon which Pandas is built.\n",

Information on these and other reader functions can be found in the Pandas [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html), which also provides useful information about the parameters for each method (e.g. how to specify what sheet you want from an Excel spreadsheet, or whether to write the index to a new CSV file).\n",

        "This chapter will use data from the Varities of Democracy (VDEM) dataset. VDEM is an ongoing research project to measure the level of democracy in governments around the world and updated versions of the dataset are released on an ongoing basis. The research is led by a team of over 50 social scientists who coordinate the collection and analysis of expert assessments from over 3,200 historians and Country Experts (CEs). From these assessments, the VDEM project has created a remarkably complex array of indicators designed to align with five high-level facets of democracy: electoral, liberal, participatory, deliberative, and egalitarian. The dataset extends back to 1789 and is considered the gold standard of quantitative data about global democratic developments. You can find the full codebook online, and I strongly recommend that you download it and consult it as you work with this data. You can find the full dataset at (https://www.v-dem.net/en/data/data/v-dem-dataset-v11/) and the codebook here (https://www.v-dem.net/figures/filer_public/e0/7f/e07f672b-b91e-4e98-b9a3-78f8cd4de696/v-dem_codebook_v8.pdf).

        "\n",
        "### The `Series`\n",
        "\n",
        "Each column in a dataframe is an object called **a Series**. A Series is a one-dimensional object (e.g. a vector of numbers) with an index, which is itself a vector, or array, of labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, the column `v2x_delibdem` in `fsdf` is a Series containing floats and the index label for each observation. Printing a sample of 15 observations gives me a numerical index for each observation on the left and the actual value on the right. The index values are ordered in the Series itself, but they are out of sequence here because we pulled a random sample. As this is for demonstration purposes, I've included a random_state value to ensure you get the same sample that I do if you re-run this block.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "fsdf['v2x_delibdem'].sample(15, random_state = 42)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In most cases, the default `index` for a Series or dataframe is an immutable vector of integers:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "fsdf.index\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "We can easily modify an index so that it is made of up some other type of vector instead, including a `string`. Surprisingly, index values do not need to be unique. This enables some powerful techniques, but most of the time, you should avoid manually changing indexes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Accessing a Specific Row by its Index\n",
        "\n",
        "We can use the index to retrieve specific rows from a dataframe or specific values from a Series, much as we would if we were selecting an element from a `list`, `tuple`, or `array`. The easiest way to do this is to pass the index value (e.g. 202) to `.loc[]`. As you can see below, the result is the observation-specific value for each variable in the dataframe.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "fsdf.loc[202]\n",
        "```\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that `.loc` does _not_ refer to the 202nd row of the dataframe. If you were looking closely at the `.index` command above, you might have noticed the dataframe only contains 18,787 rows but `.loc` can still return row 20,000 - the index didn't change when you removed a bunch of rows from the dataframe. Think of `.loc` as accessing a dictionary of the index values - it will even give a `KeyError` if you ask for an element that doesn't exist.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead, if we want the access the n-th row of a dataframe, we can use `.iloc[n]`. Think of the index as a list and you're referring to an element of that list by its list index. Let's use `.iloc` to select the last element in the dataframe. Note that the index position for the last element will be 18,786 even though the dataframe length is 18,787, because Python data structures are almost always 0-indexed. Here you see the index of the row, which was formerly the row number, as the `Name` at the bottom.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "fsdf.iloc[18786]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "If there isn't a reason to retain the original indexing of the unfiltered dataframe, it's usually a good idea to reset the index.\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Afterwards, `.loc` and `.iloc` become fairly interchangeable, with a few exceptions: `.loc` has dictionary-like capabilities whereas `.iloc` is more list-like. Now, let's take a closer look at the dataframe.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dataframes\n",
        "\n",
        "**Dataframes** in Pandas are really just collections of Series that are aligned on the same index values. In other words, the Series we worked with previously have their own indices when we work with them as standalone Series, but in the `fsdf` dataframe, they share an index.\n",
        "\n",
        "As you've already seen, dataframes are organized with variables in the columns and observations in the rows, and you can grab a single Series from a dataframe using square brakets -- let's do that now, using the `fsdf` dataframe:\n",

        "Combining dataframes is a _very_ common task. In fact, though it might not seem obvious, combining datasets is one of the most valuable skills you can have when doing computational social science. Here, we will consider some of the most common approaches: **concatenating** and **merging**, and we will briefly describe a more advanced set of methods commonly referred to as **record linkage**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Concatenating a dataframe is conceptually pretty simple - think of it like attaching the rows or columns of one dataframe below/to the right of the last row/column of another dataframe. For this to be useful, the two dataframes should have at least one row or column in common, but usually you would only concatenate if there were many such overlapping entries.\n",

        "The default behaviour for `pd.concat()` is to perform a row-wise join, which it refers to as `axis=0`. We can override this default by specifying `axis=1`, which will produce a column-wise join:\n",

        "```python\n",

        "### Merging\n",
        "\n",
        "An alternative way to combine datasets is to **merge** them. If you want to create a dataframe that contains columns from multiple datasets but is aligned on rows according to some column (or set of columns), you probably want to use the `merge()` function. To illustrate this, we will work with data from two different sources. The first is the VDEM data we used in first part of this chapter (`fsdf`). The second is a dataset from Freedom House on levels of internet freedom in 65 countries. More information is available at https://freedomhouse.org/countries/freedom-net/scores.\n",

The columns don't need to have the same name, just values that can be matched with one another. Whatever columns we choose will be called \"keys\" in our merge. In our case this will be the country name columns from each dataset.\n",

Notice how many rows each of the dataframes have: many fewer rows than the original VDEM dataframe but many more than the Freedom House dataframe. So in our case, if a row's country doesn't appear in the other dataset, that row will not be included in the merged dataframe.\n",
        "\n",
        "This can be adjusted using the `how` parameter. There are five ways of merging dataframes in Pandas: left, right, outer, inner, and cross. Check out the [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.dataframe.merge.html) to see how the other four methods work.\n",

Let's see which countries aren't common between the dataframes, using a set operation **`^` (XOR)**, which returns a set of elements from the combination of set1 and set2 that are either not in set1 or not in set2.\n",

        "We can then use the `&` set operator to see which of the missing countries are present in each of the country sets. If the data is small enough, we can print the two sets as sorted lists in a dataframe. The most obvious manual change we could do here is make \"United States\" and \"United States of America\" consistent but we would also expect Myanmar to be in the VDEM data. We could also make this change manually by knowing that Myanmar was referred to as Burma until 1989. However, it just so happens that at the top of the `south_east_asia` aggregated group dataframe from earlier, \"Burma/Myanmar\" was the name used, rather than Burma alone. For a more complex but automated solution to disambiguating different versions of country names, we would have to use some form of record linkage, discussed briefly below.\n",

        "\n",
        "The `merge` function works great when you can make _exact_ matches between columns. It also works really well because checking for exact matches has been optimized in Pandas. However, it's often the case that we need to combine datasets which cannot be merged based on exact matches.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead, we often have to use **inexact matching** (aka \"fuzzy matching\" or \"approximate matching\") to combine datasets. Typically, this involves using some similarity metric to measure how close two keys are to one another. Then a match is made based on thresholds, rules, or a nearest-neighbour approach. However, naively calculating similarity between all possible key combinations results in incredibly lengthy compute times. Instead, there are ways to exclude some key pairs from the beginning. This allows you to drastically reduce the number of comparisons you need to make. Additionally, inexact matching can leverage machine learning techniques which uses human curated examples to learn to predict whether two rows should be matched with one another.\n",
        "\n",
        "If this \"more advanced\" approach to combining datasets is of interest, I highly suggest looking into the [`recordlinkage`](https://github.com/J535D165/recordlinkage) Python package.\n",

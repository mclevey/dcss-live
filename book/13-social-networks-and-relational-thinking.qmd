# Networks: Relationships as Data

::: {.callout-warning}
## Planned Revisions

This chapter is being revised in fall 2024. The revised version will serve as a general introduction to networks (like the current version) and will include some discussion of centrality analysis, framed in terms of "paths, positions, and power." It will emphasize uncertainty and hint towards a generative perspective to be introduced later, including McElreath's provocative claim that there is no such thing as network data. Will flow into the next chapter focused on EDA.

For now, this chapter contains a couple of chapters back to back. They will be consolidated shortly (as in over the next few days).
